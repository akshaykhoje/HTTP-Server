# HTTP Server v1.1

![HTTP Server Logo](https://example.com/server_logo.png)

Welcome to the HTTP Server v1.1 project! This is a Python-based HTTP server that implements version 1.1 of the HTTP protocol. It is designed to handle various HTTP methods including HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. With multi-threading capabilities, it efficiently manages multiple client connections simultaneously.

## Features

- **HTTP/1.1 Protocol**: Implements the HTTP/1.1 protocol specification.
- **Multi-threaded**: Handles multiple client connections concurrently using threading.
- **Supported HTTP Methods**: Handles HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE methods.
- **Static and Dynamic Content**: Serves both static content (HTML, CSS, JS) and dynamic content through routing.
- **Status Codes**: Provides appropriate HTTP status codes in responses.
- **Logging**: Records server activities through log files.
- **Customizable Routing**: Easily configure routing for different URLs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Familiarity with HTTP protocol basics.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/http-server.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd http-server
    ```

### Usage

1. Configure the `routes.py` file to define your custom routing logic.

2. Add any necessary static files (HTML, CSS, JS) to the `static` directory.

3. Start the server by running:

    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

4. Access the server in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080` (default port).

5. Test different HTTP methods using tools like `curl`, Postman, or web browsers.

## Supported HTTP Methods

- **HEAD**: Retrieve the headers for a resource without the actual content.
- **GET**: Retrieve the content of a resource.
- **PUT**: Upload a resource to the server or update an existing resource.
- **POST**: Submit data to be processed by a resource, often used for form submissions.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server.
